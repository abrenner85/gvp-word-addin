  //PFB (Type1) version of the font is without Unicode ranges, and "Microsoft Character Set" is "Symbol".
  //Word uses PUA (\xF000 + code) for all the characters,

  //TrueType and OpenType fonts have Unicode ranges, and "Microsoft Character Set" is "CP1252".
  //For these versions, Word uses ANSI codes.
  //And this is the reason why AARituPlus2 is shown badly in the fonts list in Word (http://www.typophile.com/node/17084).

  //Type1 version is basic and original (true??).

  //That is why we have to convert [\x80..\x9F] range of CP1252 to plain ANSI, and then use

  //There are some characters without Unicode code point, but they have glyph name like "_0150".
  //Magically rendering engines use this information to render code points.
  //Example: _0150 = 0x96
  //InDesign maps them to PUA (\xE000 + code).
